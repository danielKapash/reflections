when I initialize a repository I can start to keep track
on the changes i make to the diffrent files in it and so 
i can always compare the diffrent commits i make and 
return to them if i choose to.

working directory is the folder that the repository and all the
files related to it are in. the repository on the other hand,
saves all the commits I make. before I make a commit i can add the files
i want to the staging area and also add a comment and only then
create a new commit.
